Algorithms in C# (many inspired by Cracking the Coding Interview)


# Overview
This repo consists of a variety of algorithms, many of which are inspired by [Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850). In this repo, I'm implementing C# versions of the algorithms discussed in the book, as well some alternatives. 

# Enviorment
I'm targeting [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) which supports [C# 12](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-12). I'm coding on Windows 11 / x64 machine, however, the code should be compatible with Linux, macOS, and Arm64.

# Issues / Comments / Questions
Please use the [Issues](https://github.com/Josh-Hurley-Consulting/algorithms-csharp/issues) section of this repo for comments or questions about my implementation.
